## DeepLearning

Today, we will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.  We will use python numpy library for all scientific computation.

First, import all packages - used in this exercise

* numpy
* matplotlib
* h5py
* PIL and Scipy

## Problem statement

You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat. Available datasets (data.h5) contains 
* Train dataset - A training dataset of m_train labled  examples
* Test dataset - A test dataset of m_test labled examples
Each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for  RBG channels
